    I have been remoting into the spice machines to use the Cadence Incisive simulator but I was wondering if I could get it on my computer.

    Believe me; you don't want it on your computer. The installation is large, and very complex. After a lengthy install process, it's entirely possible you would end up with a different configuration than is available on the lab computers.
