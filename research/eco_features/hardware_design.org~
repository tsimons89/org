* Notes on hardware design for Eco Features
** Testing harness
   I need a way to make sure that my design is working

** Random Forest
*** Tree Design
    Because the hardware will be fixed, I will build the trees with the maximum number of nodes.
    There will be no leaves that terminate a branch before the maximum depth.
**** BRAM storage
     I could either store the nodes in some standard order based on their position in the tree, or I could store them in the order that they will be produced by the eco feature which is sorted by variable number
**** Resources Needed

     My Kintex has 445 BRAMs with 36Kb each. I could probably just have every tree fit into a BRAM.
