* Notes on hardware design for Eco Features
** Testing harness
I need a way to make sure that my design is working
*** DONE Explore Agile SoC
SCHEDULED: <2017-07-06 Thu 8:30-10:00>
*** DONE Hello world with TDD for verilog [3/3]
SCHEDULED: <2017-07-07 Fri 11:00-14:00>
- [X] Get simulator
  - Can I get one of these:
    - Mentor Graphics Questa
    - Cadence Incisive
    - Synopsys VCS
    - Aldec Riviera PRO
  - I ended up using Cadence on a CAEDM spice machine
- [X] Set up simple sv unit test on desktop
- [X] Make test more meaningful
** Eco prediction block
*** Overview
This block will be loaded with training data. A driver will stream pixel values from an image and the block will make a correct prediction.

*** Eco feature block
**** Overview
- Produce every possible creature.
*** Random Forest
**** Tree Design
     Because the hardware will be fixed, I will build the trees with the maximum number of nodes.
     There will be no leaves that terminate a branch before the maximum depth.
***** BRAM storage
      I could either store the nodes in some standard order based on their position in the tree, or I could store them in the order that they will be produced by the eco feature which is sorted by variable number
***** Resources Needed
      #+TBLNAME:Estimated Bits for Node
      | Data  | Range     | Bits |
      |-------+-----------+------|
      | Var   | 0 - 10,00 |   14 |
      | Value | 22 +/-    |   21 |
      | Id    | 0 - 30    |    6 |
      |-------+-----------+------|
      | Total |           |   41 |
      #+TBLFM: $3=vsum(@2..@-1)

      My Kintex has 445 BRAMs with 36Kb each. I could probably just have every tree fit into a BRAM.
*** Schedule
**** TODO Build eco hardware
***** TODO Build eco feature block
***** TODO Build random forest block
***** TODO Integrate final design
