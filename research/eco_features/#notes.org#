* Eco Feature Project Notes
** Creating features from other features
   Because the features are simply linear filters, the output of some filters can be used for others.
*** Creating every possible filtered image
    To speed up testing and training I thought that I could create filtered result for every possible filter that could exists.
    By limiting the genomes of the filters to a cap of 5,5,1,1 I still get good results and there are only 144 different possibilities.
** Testing every filter instead of random evolution 
   With a cap of 5,5,1,1 for the genome (x_blur,y_blur,x_diff,y_diff) there are only 144 possibilities. 
   Maybe it would improve performance to just check every possibility.
*** Random sampling
    Much of the eco feature algorithm uses random. I think it is used to reduce over fitting.
*** New algorithm
**** How to determine which filter is best
     The genetic algorithm used a smaller test set from the data set to determine fitness.
     Could I use the gini impurity?
     Maybe the size of the tree?
*** Profile the training time (filter and random forest)
    On i7 desktop with the fish data set, image processing takes an average of 15,000 cycles, where training the forest (5 trees 5 deep) takes about 53,000 cycles.
** Gini heat map
   Could I use the gini purity measure to figure out which 
*** TODO Create gini heat map
** Using smaller Forests
*** Experiment 
    [[file:eco_config_results.org][Results from various configurations]]
** Using the same data set for training and testing creatures
   It seems that results are generally better and more consistant when data sets aren't split into train and hold sets
** Evaluation
   Get statistics of many training runs to see the tade
** Hardware Design
*** Random Forest
**** Tree Design
     Because the hardware will be fixed, I will build the trees with the maximum number of nodes.
     There will be no leaves that terminate a branch before the maximum depth.
***** BRAM storage
      I could either store the nodes in some standard order based on their position in the tree, or I could store them in the order that they will be produced by the eco feature which is sorted by variable number
      
***** Resources Needed
      #+TBLNAME:Estimated Bits for Node
      | Data  | Range     | Bits |
      |-------+-----------+------|
      | Var   | 0 - 10,00 |   14 |
      | Value | 22 +/-    |   21 |
      | Id    | 0 - 30    |    6 |
      |-------+-----------+------|
      | Total |           |   41 |
      #+TBLFM: $3=vsum(@2..@-1)

      My Kintex has 445 BRAMs with 36Kb each. I could probably just have every tree fit into a BRAM.
