* Petition to reinstate deleted classes
Dear BYU Admissions Officer,

My 2017 summer term class, one credit of EC EN 699R, was canceled due to a failure to pay tuition.
The tuition was to be payed by the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.
The money was allocated as a spring term scholarship instead of a summer term scholarship.
The error was not corrected until it was too late, but it has now been fixed. 
The financial transactions should be visible through my school financial records.
I am petitioning that the class be added back to my schedule.

Thank you

Taylor Simons
